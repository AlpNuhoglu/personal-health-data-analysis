# Personal Health Data Analysis

## Motivation

Many people, including myself, share a passion to maintain a healthy lifestyle through a lifetime. I have been regularly monitoring my daily calorie consumption, weight, and total amount of steps for the past year. The main purpose of this study is to use my own personal dataÂ to gain an understanding of how these variables influence my general fitness and health. I have intentions to find trends, connections, and possible areas for improvement in my everyday routine by using data science techniques.

## Main Research Questions

### Calorie Intake and Weight Changes
- **How does my daily calorie intake correlate with fluctuations in my body weight?**
- **Are there specific patterns or trends in calorie consumption that precede weight gain or loss?** 

### Physical Activity and Weight Management
- **What is the relationship between my daily step count and changes in my weight?**
- **Does increased physical activity (as measured by steps) significantly contribute to weight loss or maintenance?**

### Interplay Between Calorie Intake and Physical Activity
- **How do calorie intake and step count interact to influence my weight over time?**
- **Can we identify optimal combinations of calorie consumption and physical activity that promote healthy weight management?**

### Temporal Patterns and Long-Term Trends
- **Are there any seasonal or temporal trends in my data that affect calorie intake, step count, or weight?**
- **How have my health metrics evolved over the duration of data collection?**
